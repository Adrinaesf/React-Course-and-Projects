    1. In this section we lean: 
    - what is react: 
    -  Recall: How we reload JS to HTML 
        * <script>
        * loading the file  <script src="file_name"></script>
        * External Library: <script src="URL_of_Library"></script>

        Now react is also an external library that has code
        We can upload and use it :D

        - React helps us use teh functions to creat websites. 

    2. Review: 
    - document.querySelector: gets html elemnt an dput it into JS
    
    3. Getting Started:
    - We always need a di/container to put our react stuff into it:
    - Steps: 
        * create div elem in html
        * get it in JS using DOM
        * Write: ReactDOM.createRoot(container).render(text)
    
    - render() prints in Rect

    4. Babel: JS compiler -> Translate other languages to JS
    - In react we use enhanced version of JS: Called "JSX"
        * This is JS but accepts HTML elemt/code as well:
        * Ex: const button = <button> Hi </button> 
        
    - Problem with JSX: WEb browser can't understand JSX, solution:
        * loading the babel library
        * Tell babel to translate the code by writing: <script class="text/babel">
